## Declare an interface `IDynamic`

```typescript
interface IDynamic<T> {
    [key: string]: T;
}
```

This piece of code declares a `IDynamic` generic interface in Typescript. This interface allows for any arbitrary property (with names being a type of string) to be added to an object. The key value can be of any type that you provide as the generic (`T`). This essentialy ensures that this interface can be used for creating an object which can have dynamic properties.

## Create an object `person`

```typescript
const person: IDynamic<string | number> = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Jane",
    age: 30,
    gender: "female",
};
```

Here `person` object is defined by using the above mentioned interface `IDynamic`. By invoking `IDynamic<string | number>`, you're specifying that keys in `person` can hold either a variable of type `string` or `number`.

## Create an object `animal`

```typescript
const animal: IDynamic<string | number | typeof person> = {
    name: "Stacy",
    age: 5,
    bread: "dog",
    owner: person,
};
```

In this block, the `animal` object is created with keys that can hold `string`, `number` or the specific structure of the `person` object (`typeof person`). This is seen with the `owner` property where the entire `person` object is assigned.

Overall, this approach creates flexible objects that can change, whilst still maintaining type safety. It leverages TypeScript's generics and Index signatures functionality.
